Single Neuron Models on CIFAR-10 Dataset
This project showcases the implementation of foundational single neuron models - the Perceptron and logistic regression - built from scratch using NumPy, one of the most fundamental libraries for numerical computations in Python. Our focus is on applying these models to the CIFAR-10 dataset, a benchmark in the machine learning community for image recognition tasks. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, providing a diverse set of images for classification.

Project Overview
The core objective of this project is to explore and understand the mechanics behind simple neural network models and their application to real-world datasets. By implementing these models from the ground up, we delve into the intricacies of data preprocessing, model architecture design, optimization techniques, and the challenges of classification tasks.

Models Implemented
Perceptron: A foundational model in neural networks, representing the simplest form of a feedforward neural network. It is a linear classifier that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector.
Logistic Regression: Despite its name, logistic regression is used for binary classification tasks. It estimates probabilities using a logistic function, which is an S-shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1, but not exactly at those limits.
